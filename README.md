## ðŸ“– About Me

I'm an **IT**, **Low-level**, and **Cybersecurity** enthusiast, passionate about sharing my learning journey through insightful blogs and resources. Currently, I'm a student at **42**, diving deep into various technical domains while constantly exploring new ways to expand my knowledge.

In addition to code, I have a strong interest in:
- **Politics and Geopolitics** (understanding global dynamics and political strategies)
- **History** (fascinated by historical events and their implications)
- **Mathematics** (love exploring the beauty of numbers and problem-solving)
- **Computer Architecture and Hardware** (interested in understanding how computers are built and function, with a solid foundation in the fundamentals)

I believe in interdisciplinary learning, connecting knowledge from various fields to create a well-rounded perspective.
